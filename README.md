# The MFW IDE For Windows
*The Python IDE that is efficient, yet elegant*

**What makes mfw different?**
* The MFW IDE Is written in libx11(For Linux) or Visual C++(For Windows). Unlike some others that are written in less efficient languages.
* The MFW IDE has no AutoComplete. While you might think that this is a bad thing, unless you know Python by heart, you are likely to forget python syntax as you dont have to remember it because the IDE Completes it for you.
* The MFW IDE is open-source, so you can fork the source code and make the already efficient code even more efficient!
